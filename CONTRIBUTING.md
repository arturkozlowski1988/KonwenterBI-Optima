# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Konwerter BI.

Guidelines:
- Open an issue to discuss major changes before implementing them.
- Follow the project's code style and run tests locally via pytest.
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Keep changes small and focused; one logical change per PR.

To run tests:

1. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
2. Install dev deps (if provided): pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
3. Run pytest
